It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.",

    "description": "Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this 'algorithm' into something a computer can do, and finally how to 'write' the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done. It is sometimes the case that a machine will solve a problem in a completely different way than a human.",
